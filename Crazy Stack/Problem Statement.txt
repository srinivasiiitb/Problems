Given an empty crazy stack, the task is to perform the following 3 operations: 
• push a : Push an integer to the top of the stack. O 
• pop : Pop the top element from the stack. It is guaranteed that the stack is not empty while performing this operatiotm 
• inc x d : Add d to the bottom x elements of the stack. 
After each operation, print the top element of the stack. All test cases will only be passed if its solved optimally. 

Input format: 
First line contains n, the number of operations. Each of the next n lines is one of the above operations listed above. 

Output Format:
After each operation, print the top element of the stack. If, after an operation, the stack is empty print "EMPTY".
